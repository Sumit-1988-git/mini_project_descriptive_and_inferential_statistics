# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Mini Project 📊

This repository contains a mini project aimed at understanding key statistical concepts through both theoretical and practical approaches. The project follows a structured progression from basic statistical definitions to advanced inferential techniques such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, using Python in Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand foundational statistical concepts and terminology.
- Perform manual and Python-based calculations of mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- Apply concepts of data classification and levels of measurement.
- Visualize data using boxplots and interpret five-number summaries.
- Compute confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis testing using Z-tests.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Statistical Definitions**
2. **Measures of Central Tendency** (Mean, Median, Mode)
3. **Measures of Dispersion** (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, IQR)
4. **Levels of Measurement** (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)
5. **Five-number Summary and Boxplot**
6. **Confidence Interval Calculation**
7. **Hypothesis Testing using Z-Test**
